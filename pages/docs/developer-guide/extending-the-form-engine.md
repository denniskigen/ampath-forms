# Extending the Form Engine

You might want to customize the Form Engine in various ways. For example, you might want to:

- Add custom expression helpers.
- Add custom validators and error logic.
- Add custom components.
- Add custom fields.
- Add custom styling.
- Change how expressions get run.
- Change how questions, sections and pages get rendered, and so on.

## Running the Form Engine locally

- Fork and clone the [AMPATH Form Engine](https://github.com/ampath/ngx-openmrs-formentry) repository.
- Install dependencies by running:

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Create a production build of the Form Engine by running:

  ```sh
  npm run build:lib
  ```

- Launch a live development server on port `4200` using:

  ```sh
  npm run start
  ```

  Visit `https://localhost:4200` in your browser. You should see a [sample form](https://github.com/AMPATH/ngx-openmrs-formentry/blob/master/src/app/adult-1.4.json) rendered in the default `Encounter Viewer` view. Here, you're able to interact with the various form fields and even submit the form.

- Modify the Form Engine. Changes made to the Form Engine will be reflected automatically in the live development server.
