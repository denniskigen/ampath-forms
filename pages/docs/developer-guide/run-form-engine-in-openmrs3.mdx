# Running the Form Engine against an OpenMRS 3.x frontend

Presently, [OpenMRS 3.x](https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs) (O3) ships with a [custom version](https://github.com/ampath/ngx-openmrs-formentry) of the Form Engine.

This version leverages the [Carbon design system](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) to get its look and feel to match that of O3.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  You can track the progress of _carbonizing_ the Form Engine via the
  [3.0.0.carbonize](https://github.com/ampath/ngx-openmrs-formentry/tree/3.0.0-carbonize)
  branch. Alternatively, you could follow the OpenMRS
  [fork](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-ngx-formentry) of the Form Engine.
</Callout>

If you wish to modify the Form Engine and test it within O3 (or any other O3-based frontends),follow the steps outlined below:

## Prerequisites

You need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed on your system. You can check for whether yarn is installed by running:

```sh
  yarn -v
```

If this doesn't return a version number, you likely don't have it installed. To install it on your system, run:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

Additionally, the [openmrs-esm-patient-chart](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-chart) repository expects you to have `Node.js v16.x.x` or higher installed on your system.

## Steps

- Fork and clone the [AMPATH formentry](https://github.com/ampath/ngx-openmrs-formentry) repository.
- `cd` into your clone and checkout the `3.0.0-carbonize` branch.
- Install dependencies by running:

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Make changes to the library.

- Create a production build of the library by running:

  ```sh
  npm run build:lib
  ```

  Note the full path to the `dist/ngx-formentry` directory created in this step. It will be needed further ahead.

- Next, open your local `openmrs-esm-patient-chart` clone. Install dependencies using:

  ```sh
  yarn
  ```

- We'll then install the `dist/ngx-formentry` directory from the previous step inside of `packages/esm-form-entry-app`. To do so, run:

  ```sh
  cd packages/esm-form-entry-app
  yarn add ...

  # where ... is the path to your dist/ngx-formentry directory from the previous step. It could look like: /Users/johndoe/code/ampath/ngx-openmrs-formentry/dist/ngx-formentry.
  ```

    If you're using Windows, you might need to wrap your path in double quotes.
  </Callout>

  It is very important that this step works correctly to establish the link between the formentry library and the frontend.

- Next, `cd` into the form-entry package in your local patient chart copy:

  ```sh
    cd packages/esm-form-entry-app
  ```

  And then spin up our local copy of formentry by running:

  ```sh
    yarn serve
  ```

  This command should fire up a dev server on port 4200.

- Next, log into your 3.x frontend (could be `AMPATH 3.x`, `KenyaEMR 3.x`, or a community server like `dev3`) in your browser.

- Make sure that import-map overrides are enabled. If they are, you should see a small grey box at the bottom right hand corner of your screen. If you don't see the overrides icon:

  - Open your browser devtools console and run:

    ```sh
    localStorage.setItem('openmrs:devtools', true);
    ```

  - Reload your browser window for the changes to take effect.

- Next, click the box icon to launch the devtools overrides panel. From the search box, find the import map entry for `@openmrs/esm-form-entry`. Click on the item in the list - this should launch a modal where you can type in your override URL. Type in:

  ```
  http://localhost:4200/openmrs-esm-form-entry-app.js
  ```

  Reload your browser window for the changes to take effect.

- Congratulations! You should now be running the local version of formentry in your application. To test your changes anew, rebuild the library again by running `npm run build:lib` in your local formentry clone. The frontend should pick up the changes automatically.

- To test, search for a patient and open their chart. Find the forms widget and launch a clinical form in the workspace. Any changes made to the formentry app should propagate into the form displayed in the workspace.

  <Callout emoji="ℹ️">
    Note that O3 caches the forms you've opened in your browser's
    `localStorage`. If you're not seeing the latest changes when you load your
    form in the workspace, it could be because you're viewing a cached version.
    Make sure to find and delete the `localStorage` entry for your form and then
    reload to fetch it anew.
  </Callout>

- To propagate your changes to your server, you'd need to test them and once satisfied that they're working as they should, package them in a pull request and get them merged to the formentry repository. You'd then need to deploy those changes to your server.

- Profit!

## Troubleshooting

### I get an `Invalid webpack configuration` error when I run `yarn serve`

- If you're using Windows, you may see the following error when you run `yarn serve` in the `esm-form-entry` directory:

  ```
  An unhandled exception occurred: Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialised using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.

  configuration.entry['main'] should not contain the item 'C:\Workspace\example\project-example\node_modules\webpack-dev-server\client\index.js?http://0.0.0.0:0&sockPath=/sockjs-node' twice.
  -> A non-empty array of non-empty strings
  ```

  This is a known issue with [single-spa-angular](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-angular/issues/328). To work around this, you can modify the `yarn serve` script entry in the `package.json` file in the `esm-form-entry` package as follows:

  ```json
  "serve": "ng serve --port 4200 --live-reload false",
  ```

### I don't see my changes propagated in my SPA environment

- Make sure you have saved your changes in the formentry library and run:

  ```sh
  npm run build:lib
  ```

  To ensure you have the very latest changes in the patient chart, make sure to rerun `yarn add {path-to-dist/ngx-formentry}` in your `esm-form-entry` package directory.

- If you still don't see your changes, make sure you're overriding the `esm-form-entry-app` in the import map overrides panel.
