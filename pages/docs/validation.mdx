# Validation

AMPATH Forms enables you to add arbitrarily complex validation to your form inputs. Broadly, two approaches for validating inputs are possible:

- Date-based validation
- JavaScript expression-based validation

## Date-based validation

This type of validation enforces certain conditions for [date](/field-types-reference#date) inputs. You can use date-based validation to guarantee that a Date input only allows:

- Past or present dates
- Past, present or future dates

Here's a question from the Reproductive History section of an HIV Adult Return visit form.

```json
{
  "label": "LMP",
  "id": "lmpDate1",
  "questionOptions": {
    "concept": "a89ff758-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
    "rendering": "date"
  },
  "type": "obs",
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "date"
    },
    {
      "type": "js_expression",
      "failsWhenExpression": "isEmpty(myValue) && !isEmpty(pattype1) && pattype1 === '375e6d4a-ba94-41ac-8ac3-5a56015c4d92'",
      "message": "Patient is antenatal. Please provide LMP."
    },
    {
      "type": "js_expression",
      "failsWhenExpression": "isEmpty(myValue) && !isEmpty(menStatus) && menStatus === 'a8ad2b4e-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'",
      "message": "Patient is menstruating. Please provide LMP."
    }
  ],
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": " sex !== 'F' || menStatus !== 'a8ad2b4e-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
  }
}
```

This question seeks to establish when the client last menstruated (LMP is short for `Last menstrual period`). Note that the first value of the validators array is a validator of type `date`. To properly understand what this date validator is doing, it might help to look at its source code:

```javascript
// Question validator factory
if (question.validators) {
  _.forEach(question.validators, (validator: ValidationModel) => {
    switch (validator.type) {
      case 'date':
        list.push(this.dateValidator);
        const allowFutureDates: boolean = (<DateValidationModel>validator)
          .allowFutureDates;

        if (!allowFutureDates) {
          list.push(this.futureDateRestrictionValidator);
        }
        break;
        // more code ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We see that the validator optionally has a property named `allowFutureDates` and that this property defaults to `false`. The date validator will, by default, not allow you to set a future date as the value of the field. If you do so, it will render a validation error:

You can override this behaviour and permit future dates by setting `allowFutureDates` to true in your validator definition:

```json
{
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "date",
      "allowFutureDates": "true"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation based on JavaScript expressions

When using expressions to validate form inputs, you must provide a JavaScript expression that resolves to a boolean value. Below is an expression-based example from a form used for collecting Cervical Cancer screening data:

![Expression-based validation example](/screens/expression-based-validation.png)

```json
{
  "type": "obs",
  "label": "HIV Status",
  "isExpanded": "true",
  "questions": [
    {
      "label": "What is your current HIV status?",
      "id": "hivStatus",
      "type": "obs",
      "required": "true",
      "historicalExpression": "_.isEmpty(HD.getObject('prevEnc').getValue('9e4d6436-4040-46a3-a0ae-6dbc0acfe593')) ? undefined : HD.getObject('prevEnc').getValue('9e4d6436-4040-46a3-a0ae-6dbc0acfe593')",
      "questionOptions": {
        "rendering": "select",
        "concept": "9e4d6436-4040-46a3-a0ae-6dbc0acfe593",
        "answers": [
          {
            "concept": "a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "HIV positive"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a896d2cc-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "HIV negative"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a899b50a-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "Unknown"
          }
        ]
      },
      "validators": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Are you currently in HIV care or under ART?",
      "id": "currentlyOnArt",
      "type": "obs",
      "questionOptions": {
        "rendering": "select",
        "concept": "a8afba58-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
        "answers": [
          {
            "concept": "a899b35c-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "concept": "a899b42e-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838",
            "label": "No"
          }
        ]
      },
      "validators": [
        {
          "type": "js_expression",
          "failsWhenExpression": "isEmpty(myValue) && hivStatus == 'a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'",
          "message": "Please indicate whether the client is currently in HIV care or under ART"
        }
      ],
      "hide": {
        "hideWhenExpression": "isEmpty(hivStatus) || hivStatus != 'a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</Callout>

A lot is going on in this example. Let us attempt to break it down step by step. The first question (id `hivStatus`) seeks to establish the client's HIV status. The next question (id `currentlyOnArt`) asks whether the client is actively receiving HIV care. Note that this second question has validation enabled.

```json
{
  // ...
  "validators": [
    {
      "type": "js_expression",
      "failsWhenExpression": "isEmpty(myValue) && hivStatus == 'a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'",
      "message": "Please indicate whether the client is currently in HIV care or under ART"
    }
  ]
  // ...
}
```

We see that the `type` of the validator is `js_expression`, which indicates that we're using JavaScript expression-based validation. The `failsWhenExpression` property takes a JavaScript expression as its value. The expression evaluates two conditions:

1. That this question (id `currentlyOnArt`) gets answered. `isEmpty(myValue)` returns `true` if this question does not get answered, and `false` otherwise.
2. That the previous question (id `hivStatus`) has the answer with the value `a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838`. This value corresponds to the value labelled `HIV Positive`.

When the current HIV status gets set to `HIV Positive` and the next question is left unanswered, the validation kicks in and displays the contents of the `message` property as a validation error.

![Expression-based validation](/screens/js-expression-based-validation.gif)

You might wonder, why not just mark the `Are you currently in HIV care or under ART?` question as required and avoid the whole ceremony? Well, what you'll notice is that this question also has a `hide` property:

```json
{
  // ...
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": "isEmpty(hivStatus) || hivStatus != 'a896f3a6-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
  }
}
```

This hide logic ensures that this second question stays hidden until the answer to the preceding question gets set to `HIV Positive`. You can learn more about the hide property in the hiding form fields guide.
