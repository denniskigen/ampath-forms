## The Form Builder

When working with AMPATH Forms, the primary tool we'll be using is the Form Builder. The Form Builder provides an easy to use UI with which we can create forms of arbitrary complexity.

When you first visit the Form Builder [website](https://openmrs-spa.org/formbuilder/#/login), you'll see a login screen.

Choose `https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs` in the **OpenMRS Server URL** field and then enter your login credentials to sign in.

Once signed in, you should see this landing page.

Features on this page include:

- The `Create a new form` button. Clicking on this launches the Schema editor.
- The `Forms List view` dropdown. You can use it to toggle between displaying Forms and Components.
- The `Forms List search bar`. You can use it to search through the available forms by name.
- The `Forms List filter`. You can use this filter to limit your search to only forms that are published.
- The `Forms List` - A list of all the forms saved to the backend server. From it, you can see the form names and versions, their published status, their retired status, and a list of actions you can take. These actions include the ability to:
  - Edit a form schema. Clicking the `Edit` button loads the selected form's schema in the [Schema editor](#the-schema-editor).
  - Download a form schema by clicking the `Download` button.
  - Import a form schema by clicking the `Import` button. Useful for a when a form is missing the associated schema.
- `Pagination controls` - These are at the bottom of the Forms List. They allow you to navigate between the items in the Forms List.

## The Schema editor

The Schema editor is the area where you'll do most of your work.

You can access the Schema editor in two ways:

- Clicking **Create a new form** to create a new form or a Component.
- Clicking the pen icon next to a form in the Forms List to edit an existing schema.

### Features of the Schema editor

- The interactive **Schema Builder**. Accessible by clicking the hamburger menu at the far left of the navigation bar.
- The **File** menu. From it, you can either:

  - **Save a form locally** by persisting the schema to your browse's LocalStorage.
  - **Save a form to the server**.

- The **View** menu. Allows you to toggle between **Tab View** and **Split View** modes.
- The **Tasks** menu. Allows you to:

  - Add Concept Mappings to your schema.
  - Validate Concepts.

- The **User info** menu. This menu shows information about the logged-in user.
- The **Audit info** menu. This menu shows audit information for a form schema. This information includes form metadata such as the form name, UUID, version, description, and the associated Encounter Type. It also shows who created or modified a form and when.
- The **Manage Referenced Forms** button. Clicking this button shows a list of components referenced by the active form. It also allows you to reference Components from a handy dropdown menu.

  Components are reusable forms that encapsulate related logic. They can be
  mixed and matched to create complex forms. Read more about components in the
  [Referencing Forms](/referencing-forms) guide.

- The **Publish form** button. Allows you to publish your form schema.
- The **Schema editor tab** renders a JSON-based representation of your form schema in an embedded code editor.
- The **Form Viewer** tab renders the visual representation of your form schema once it gets compiled by the form engine.
- The **Render form** button. Clicking this button enables the form engine to compile your form schema. This step ensures that your form schema is valid and free of errors.
- The **build timestamp** at the bottom right of the page shows information the current build version.

## The Form viewer

The Form viewer renders the compiled form schema. It provides an interactive visual representation of how the form would look in your frontend.

You can update the form viewer at any time by clicking `Render form`. From the screenshot above, we can glean the following information:

- The `pages` included in the form. This form has one page called `Consent Elicitation`.
- The `sections` of the form. This form has one section called `Consent`.
- A `Submit form` button.
