# Creating a new form

## Quickstart

Let's take you from zero to published in just a few minutes.

Visit the Form Builder [website](https://formbuilder.o3.openmrs.org/) and sign in with the following credentials:

- OpenMRS Server URL: `https://dev3.openmrs.org/openmrs`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Admin123`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you experience problems logging in, it could be due to CORS. As the Form
  Builder frontend runs on a different server than the backend, we rely on
  [CORS](https://geekflare.com/cors-basics/) to handle communication between
  these two origins. You may need to configure your server or install an
  extension in your browser that bypasses CORS checks to log in successfully.
</Callout>

## Create a New Form

Click the button labelled `Create a new form` in the navigation bar.

![Landing page](/screens/landing.webp)

You will be directed to the Schema editor. You could toggle between a `Tab view` and `Split view` from the `View` option in the navigation menu. By default, the editor will have a basic schema scaffold open.

![Schema editor](/screens/schema-editor.webp)

Next, you'll need to provide a name for the new form. You could type in the name directly into the `name` field of the schema. Alternatively, you could use the interactive schema builder. Click the hamburger menu in the navbar to launch the builder. Type in `Test POC Patient Consent Form v1.0` as the name of your form. Click the green tick to the left when done to update the schema.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  Presently, your form name must to contain the word **POC** for it to be deemed
  valid. For example, **Test POC form** is a valid form name while **Yet Another
  Test form** is not.
</Callout>

### Add a Page

Add a page by clicking `Create new page`. This should launch a modal where you can provide a page label. Let's add a page labelled `Consent Elicitation`.

![Add a page to the form](/screens/add-page.webp)

### Add a Section

Add a section by clicking `Create new section`. We'll add a section to the form labelled `Consent`. Sections are rendered in collapsed mode by default. Set `isExpanded` to `true` so the section gets rendered in expanded mode.

### Add a Question

Add a question by clicking `Create new question`. This launches the **Question Editor** panel.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  The question editor panel provides concept lookup functionality via your
  concept dictionary. This functionality is contingent on your having set up the
  relevant concepts ahead of time in your dictionary. This guidance makes the
  assumption that your environment has a `PATIENT CONSENT PROVIDED` concept with
  the ID `7656` configured.
</Callout>

![Add a question to the form](/screens/consent-question.webp)

- Enter `Do you consent to having your information recorded` as the label.
- Set the `Type` of the question to `obs`.
- Set the `Rendering` to `select`.
- Set the `ID` of the question to `consentStatus`.
- Enter `PATIENT CONSENT PROVIDED` in the `Concept` field and click the search icon. This will launch a modal where you can conduct a concept search lookup. You could search based on the concept name, concept ID, or concept UUID. In this example, this concept search is conducted from the AMPATH concept dictionary. The `PATIENT CONSENT PROVIDED` concept referenced here has the concept ID `7656`. Press **OK** to save.

![Concept lookup](/screens/concept-lookup.webp)

A modal should now appear asking you to pick your desired Answers from a list of available Answers. Click **Select All** to choose both `YES` and `NO`.

![Select answers from concept lookup modal](/screens/concept-lookup-select-answers-modal.webp)

Click **OK** to save. You should now see the associated Concept Mappings and the Answers you chose displayed in the Question Editor.

![Question editor showing selected concept mappings and answers](/screens/concept-mappings-and-answers.webp)

Click **OK** to save your form schema at this point. You should see an alert showing that the schema was updated successfully.

Your schema should now look like this:

```json filename="Test POC Patient Consent Form v1.0.json"

                      },

                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ]
              },
              "id": "consentStatus"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Render your Form

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  You can test your form at any point during the development process by clicking
  the `Render form` button in the Schema editor.
</Callout>

Click `Render form` to test out your form. If your JSON schema is invalid, you will see an error displayed at the top of the Schema editor. Otherwise, if your schema is valid, it gets compiled by the form engine and rendered into a form in the `Form Viewer`.

The schema we've created gets rendered as:

![Schema editor with Render Form button](/screens/rendered-schema.webp)

It's looking like we're ready to ship our form. Let's do that.

## Save your Form

To commit your form to the server, click **File** in the navigation menu and then click **Save to Server**. This will launch a modal asking you to provide the following information about the form:

- The `name` of the form (as you wish for it to appear in the server).
- The `version` of the form e.g. v1.0.
- The `Encounter type` linked to the form.
- A short `description` of the form.

![Save modal](/screens/save-modal.webp)

Once done, click **OK** to save your form, and then click **Exit** to leave the Schema editor.

You should now be able to see your new form in the Forms List.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  You could choose to publish your form by clicking `Publish form` when in the
  Schema editor.
