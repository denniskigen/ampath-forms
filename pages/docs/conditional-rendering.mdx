# Rendering Fields Conditionally

You can render Form fields conditionally by defining a `hideWhenExpression` inside the `hide` property of your question definitions.

A `hideWhenExpression` is a JavaScript expression that returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). [Logical operators](https://javascript.info/logical-operators) are used to construct these expressions. Additionally, you can incorporate injected data sources and expression helper functions into your expression definitions.

```json
{
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": "onArt!== 'a899b35c-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
  }
}
```

In the example above, the logic provided instructs the Form Builder to hide (not render) the question with the `onArt` id if the value of its backing concept does not match the supplied value.
