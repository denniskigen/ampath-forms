# Rendering Fields Conditionally

You can render Form fields conditionally by defining a `hideWhenExpression` inside the `hide` property of your question definitions.

A `hideWhenExpression` is a JavaScript expression that returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`). [Logical operators](https://javascript.info/logical-operators) are used to construct these expressions. Additionally, you can incorporate injected data sources and expression helper functions into your expression definitions.

To write a `hideWhenExpression`, include a code block like this within the `questions` array of your
[question](/docs/core-concepts/questions) definition:

```json
{
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": "isEmpty(onArt) || onArt !== 'a899b35c-1350-11df-a1f1-0026b9348838'"
  }
}
```

In the example above, the logic provided instructs the Form Builder to hide (not render) the question with the `onArt` id if the value of its backing concept does not match the supplied value.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
  Note that at the moment it is only possible to render <b>questions</b>{' '}
  conditionally. AMPATH Forms does not <em>explicitly</em> support hiding
  sections or pages.
</Callout>

## More examples

#### 1. Using the `isEmpty` helper

```json
{
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": "isEmpty(screenedForHepatitisB) || screenedForHepatitisB == '1066AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'"
  }
}
```

In this example, the question being validated gets hidden if the question with the id `screenedForHepatitisB` is empty or if its value is the answer backed by the concept ID `1066AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`. Most often, if your `hideWhenExpression` is not working, it's likely because you did not use the [isEmpty](/docs/expression-helpers#isempty) helper as shown above.

#### 2. Using the `sex` model from a `patient` data source

```json
{
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": "sex !== 'F'"
  }
}
```

In this example, the question being validated gets hidden if the patient's sex is `F`. For this expression to work, you would need to plug in a patient object that exposes a gender property mapped to either `F` (for female) or `M` (for male).
Read more about this in the [data sources](/docs/advanced-topics/injecting-data-sources/) guide.

#### 3. Using the `age` model from a `patient` data source

```json
{
  "hide": {
    "hideWhenExpression": "age >= 18"
  }
}
```

In this example, the question being validated gets hidden if the patient's age is greater than or equal to 18. For this expression to work, you would need to plug in a patient object that exposes an age value. Read more about this in the [data sources](/docs/advanced-topics/injecting-data-sources/) guide.
