# Form Viewer

The Form viewer renders the compiled form schema. It provides an interactive visual representation of how the form would look in your frontend.

You can update the form viewer at any time by clicking `Render form`. From the screenshot above, we can glean the following information:

- The `pages` included in the form. This form has one page called `Consent Elicitation`.
- The `sections` of the form. This form has one section called `Consent`.
- A `Submit form` button.
