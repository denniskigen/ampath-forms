# Schema Editor

The Schema Editor embeds a [code editor](https://ace.c9.io/) which is configured to accept JSON code. Upon clicking the `Render Form` button, your JSON code will get validated and rendered into a form in the Form Viewer tab. If your code is invalid, and error message will be displayed above the editor.

You can access the Schema editor by:
