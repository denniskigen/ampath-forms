# Schema Editor

The Schema editor is the area where you'll do most of your work.

You can access the Schema editor in two ways:

- Clicking **Create a new form** to create a new form or a Component.
- Clicking the pen icon next to a form in the Forms List to edit an existing schema.

## Features of the Schema editor

- The interactive **Schema Builder**. Accessible by clicking the hamburger menu at the far left of the navigation bar.
- The **File** menu. From it, you can either:

  - **Save a form locally** by persisting the schema to your browse's LocalStorage.
  - **Save a form to the server**.

- The **View** menu. Allows you to toggle between **Tab View** and **Split View** modes.
- The **Tasks** menu. Allows you to:

  - Add Concept Mappings to your schema.
  - Validate Concepts.

- The **User info** menu. This menu shows information about the logged-in user.
- The **Audit info** menu. This menu shows audit information for a form schema. This information includes form metadata such as the form name, UUID, version, description, and the associated Encounter Type. It also shows who created or modified a form and when.
- The **Manage Referenced Forms** button. Clicking this button shows a list of components referenced by the active form. It also allows you to reference Components from a handy dropdown menu.

  Components are reusable forms that encapsulate related logic. They can be
  mixed and matched to create complex forms. Read more about components in the
  [Referencing Forms](/docs/referencing-forms) guide.

- The **Publish form** button. Allows you to publish your form schema.
- The **Schema editor tab** renders a JSON-based representation of your form schema in an embedded code editor.
- The **Form Viewer** tab renders the visual representation of your form schema once it gets compiled by the form engine.
- The **Render form** button. Clicking this button enables the form engine to compile your form schema. This step ensures that your form schema is valid and free of errors.
- The **build timestamp** at the bottom right of the page shows information the current build version.
