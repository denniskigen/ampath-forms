# Forms

A form represents a collection of pages, sections and questions. Forms are described using schemas written in JSON. The most basic valid form schema looks as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "pages": [],
  "processor": "EncounterFormProcessor",
  "uuid": "xxxx",
  "referencedForms": []
}
```

Form schemas get constructed using the Schema editor. When you launch the Schema editor, you get presented with a default form scaffold with the code shown above.

## Defining a `Form`

A form definition has the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the form.

  <Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
    Presently, form names must contain the word **POC** to be considered valid.
    For example, **Test POC form** is a valid form name while **Yet Another Test
    form** is not.
  </Callout>

- `pages`: The collection of [pages](/docs/core-concepts/pages) that make up your form. You can add pages to a form by adding page definitions to the `pages` array.

- `processor`: Defaults to `EncounterFormProcessor`. The form processor converts an OpenMRS REST form response into a format that the form renderer can process and display. Conversely, the form processor also converts the submitted form payload into a format that the REST backend can understand.

- `referencedForms`: The collection of [components](/docs/core-concepts/components) that the form references. You can build a form by adding components to it using the **Reference Forms** feature of the Form Builder. Read more about referencing forms in the [referencing components](/docs/referencing-components) guide.

- `uuid`: The UUID of your form. This UUID gets autogenerated by the Form Builder when you save a form successfully.
