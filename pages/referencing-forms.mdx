# Referencing Forms

This feature of the Form Builder allows you to build your forms by importing logic from [component forms](/core-concepts#components). Components are a mechanism for grouping together domain-specific form logic into disparate, reusable bits. You can mix and match components to create forms of arbitrary complexity. Imagine building a form for use in HIV Testing. This form might require the following sections:

- A pre-clinic review section
- A vitals section
- A lab order section
- A lab results section
- An HIV status section
- A Tuberculosis treatment section

It is possible to encapsulate each of the above pieces into a disparate reusable component. You would then have, say, a Pre-Clinic Review component that handles pre-clinic review concerns. This component would have sections such as:

- A patient's current HIV status
- Whether a visit was scheduled or not
- Reasons for a visit
- The current visit type
- A patient's insurance information

This component could look something like this:

So if, for example, you were constructing a new Cervical Cancer screening visit form, you might want to pick just the Pre-Clinic Review section from that component. Below if a guide for how you can achieve this:

## Example: Referencing the Pre-Clinic Review component

  For this guide, we will assume that we are working on a new form.
</Callout>

### Step 1. Launch form in Schema Editor

Click the Create New button to launch the Schema Editor.

### Step 2. Reference the Component

Launch the Schema Builder by clicking the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the page. Click Create a new page and enter `Preclinical Review` as the page label.

Click Reference Section and enter `component_oncology-preclinic-review-v1.2` as the form name.

![Referencing a section](/screens/referencing-a-section.png)

A modal should appear asking you to choose the sections you want to reference. We will select two sections:
`Pre-Clinic Review` and `Reasons for Current Visit`. Make sure to tick the boxes next to those labels.

Further, we want to limit which questions we want to show from those sections. Expand the `Reasons for Current Visit` question and remove the last two questions labelled:

- What insurance do you have?
- Do you have a family member or caregiver who assists you with taking care of your health needs?

By this point, you should have the following options in your section reference configuration:

The Schema Builder panel should show the following layout:

![Section reference in the Schema Builder](/screens/section-reference-view.png)

Exit the Schema Builder by clicking anywhere on the page. Click the blue Render button to compile the form. Once you see the `Schema updated` alert, click the `Form Viewer` tab to see the visual representation of our form.

You can follow this approach to reference as many component forms as you wish. Once done, click File > Save to Server to save your form.

As you've observed, component forms provide a powerful mechanism for encapsulating shared form logic into reusable chunks.
