# Editing Forms

Here are instructions for how to edit an existing form using the Form Builder.

## Step 1. Find the Form

Begin by searching for the form you want to work on by typing the form name in the search input at the top right-hand section of the Forms List. Alternatively, use the pagination controls at the bottom of the page to navigate the Forms List.

## Step 2. Launch the Form in Edit mode

Click the pen icon to the right of the form name in the Forms List to launch it in the Schema Editor.

You should see the Form schema rendered in the Schema Editor.

## Step 3. Make changes to your Form

You can begin to make amendments to the form schema. Note that you can see a visual representation of your amended form at any time by clicking the `Render` button at the bottom of the page. Provided your form schema is valid, the form engine should render the Form and update its visual representation. You can then click on the `Form Viewer` tab at the top of the page to reveal the updated visual representation.

## Step 4. Save your Form

When you're done making changes to your form, click `File` and select `Save to Server`.

If you want to overwrite the existing form schema, select `Update current version`. Otherwise, if you wish to save the schema as a new version, select `Save as new version`.
