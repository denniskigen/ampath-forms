AMPATH Forms is a tool that helps you build and render OpenMRS form schemas. It consists of a form builder and a form engine. The form builder enables users to build form schemas of arbitrary complexity. These schemas can be built interactively or by writing JSON code inside the Schema editor. Once built, the form engine processes and renders these schemas. Users can test their forms within the form builder as well as saving them either locally or to a server. Once published, these forms can be made available to a frontend for data entry.
