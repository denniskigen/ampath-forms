# AMPATH Forms

**AMPATH Forms** is a comprehensive "batteries-included" solution for building JSON-based form schemas.

Our Form Builder enables you to schemas of arbitrary complexity. These schemas can be built interactively using the Interactive Form Builder or declaratively by writing JSON code in the Schema Editor. Once built, our Form Engine processes and renders your form schema in a handy UI that you can use to test to your forms. Once done, you can save and publish your forms to a server and make them available to your frontend.
